# Inside the Write Model

## Aggregate

아래의 코드는 Order 애그리거트의 도메인 코드를 나타낸 것이다

```java
@Getter
public class Order implements AbstractAggregateRoot, EventPublisher {

    private Long id;
    private Long conferenceId;
    private Long userId;
    private List<Event> events;
    private List<TicketOrderLine> lines;
    private OrderState state;

    public void markAsBooked() {
        if (!CREATED.equals(state)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        state = BOOKED;
    }

    public void reject() {
        if (!CREATED.equals(state)) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        state = REJECTED;
    }
}
```

```C#
public class Order :IAggregateRoot, IEventPublisher {
    public static class States {
        public const
        int Created = 0;
        public const
        int Booked = 1;
        public const
        int Rejected = 2;
        public const
        int Confirmed = 3;
    }

    private List<IEvent> events = new List<IEvent>(); ...
    public Guid Id {
        get;
        private set ;
    }
    public Guid UserId {
        get;
        private set ;
    }
    public Guid ConferenceId {
        get;
        private set ;
    }
    public virtual ObservableCollection<TicketOrderLine > Lines {
        get;
        private set ;
    } public int State {
        get;
        private set ;
    }
    public IEnumerable<Ievent> Events {
        get {
            return this.events;
        }
    }
    public void MarkAsBooked () {
        if (this.State != States.Created) {
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        }
        this.State = States.Booked;
    }
    public void Reject () {
        if (this.State != States.Created) {
            throw new InvalidOperationException();
        }
        this.State = States.Rejected;
    }
}
```

Notice how the properties of the class are not virtual. In the original version of this class, the proper- ties Id, UserId, ConferenceId, and State were all marked as virtual. The following conversation be- tween two developers explores this decision.

#### Developer 1

I’m really convinced you should not make the property virtual, except if required by the object-relational mapping (ORM) layer. If this is just for testing purposes, entities and ag- gregate roots should never be tested using mocking. If you need mocking to test your entities, this is a clear smell that something is wrong in the design.

#### Developer 2

I prefer to be open and extensible by default. You never know what needs may arise in the future, and making things virtual is hardly a cost. This is certainly controversial and a bit non-standard in .NET, but I think it’s OK. We may only need virtuals on lazy-loaded collec- tions.

#### Developer 1

Since CQRS usually makes the need for lazy load vanish, you should not need it either. This leads to even simpler code.

#### Developer 2

CQRS does not dictate usage of event sourcing (ES), so if you’re using an aggre- gate root that contains an object graph, you’d need that anyway, right?

#### Developer 1

This is not about ES, it’s about DDD. When your aggregate boundaries are right, you don’t need delay loading.

#### Developer 2

To be clear, the aggregate boundary is here to group things that should change to- gether for reasons of consistency. A lazy load would indicate that things that have been grouped together don’t really need this grouping.

#### Developer 1

I agree. I have found that lazy-loading in the command side means I have it mod- eled wrong. If I don’t need the value in the command side, then it shouldn’t be there. In addition, I dislike virtuals unless they have an intended purpose (or some artificial requirement from an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool). In my opinion, it violates the Open-Closed principle: you have opened yourself up for modification in a variety of ways that may or may not be intended and where the repercussions might not be immediately discoverable, if at all.

#### Developer 2

Our Order aggregate in the model has a list of Order Items. Surely we don’t need to load the lines to mark it as Booked? Do we have it modeled wrong there?

#### Developer 1

Is the list of Order Items that long? If it is, the modeling may be wrong because you don’t necessarily need transactionality at that level. Often, doing a late round trip to get and updated Order Items can be more costly that loading them up front: you should evaluate the usual size of the collection and do some performance measurement. Make it simple first, opti- mize if needed.
